                    Streamed Oblivious HTTP Messages
                    draft-ohai-streamed-ohttp-latest

Abstract

   This document defines a variant of the Oblivious HTTP message format
   that allows chunks of requests and responses to be encrypted and
   decrypted before an entire message is processed.  This allows
   "streaming" of Oblivious HTTP messages, which is particularly useful
   for handling very large messages or systems that process messages
   slowly.

1.  Introduction

   Oblivious HTTP [OHTTP] defines a system for sending HTTP requests and
   responses as encrypted messages.  Clients send requests via a relay
   to a gateway, which is able to decrypt and forward the request to a
   target server.  Responses are encrypted with an ephemeral symmetric
   key by the gateway and sent back to the client via the relay.  The
   messages are protected with Hybrid Public Key Encryption (HPKE;
   [HPKE]), and are intended to prevent the gateway from linking any two
   independent requests to the same client.

   The definition of Oblivious HTTP in [OHTTP] encrypts messages such
   that entire request and response bodies need to be received before
   any of the content can be decrypted.  This is well-suited for many of
   the use cases of Oblivious HTTP, such as DNS queries or metrics
   reporting.

   However, some applications of Oblivious HTTP can benefit from being
   able to encrypt and decrypt parts of the messages in chunks.  If a
   request or response can be processed by a receiver in separate parts,
   and is particularly large or will be generated slowly, then sending a
   stream of encrypted chunks can improve the performance of
   applications.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Request Format

   Streamed OHTTP requests start with key and algorithm IDs, followed by
   chunks of data protected with HPKE.  The final chunk is indicated
   with a length of 0, which means it extends to the end of the outer
   stream.

   Streamed Encapsulated Request {
     Key Identifier (8),
     HPKE KEM ID (16),
     HPKE KDF ID (16),
     HPKE AEAD ID (16),
     Encapsulated KEM Shared Secret (8 * Nenc),
     HPKE-Protected Request Data (..),
   }

   HPKE-Protected Request Data {
     Non-Final Chunk (..),
     Final Chunk Indicator (i) = 0,
     HPKE-Protected Final Chunk (..),
   }

   Non-Final Chunk {
     Length (i) = 1..,
     HPKE-Protected Chunk (..),
   }

               Figure 1: Streamed Encapsulated Request Format

4.  Response Format

   Streamed OHTTP responses start with a nonce, followed by chunks of
   data protected with an AEAD.  The final chunk is indicated with a
   length of 0, which means it extends to the end of the outer stream.

   Streamed Encapsulated Response{
     Nonce (Nk),
     AEAD-Protected Request Data (..),
   }

   AEAD-Protected Request Data {
     Non-Final Chunk (..),
     Final Chunk Indicator (i) = 0,
     AEAD-Protected Final Chunk (..),
   }

   Non-Final Chunk {
     Length (i) = 1..,
     AEAD-Protected Chunk (..),
   }

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document updates the "Media Types" registry at
   https://iana.org/assignments/media-types
   (https://iana.org/assignments/media-types) to add the media types
   "message/ohttp-streamed req" (Section 6.1), and "message/ohttp-
   streamed-res" (Section 6.2), following the procedures of [RFC6838].

6.1.  message/ohttp-streamed-req Media Type

   The "message/ohttp-streamed-req" identifies an encrypted binary HTTP
   request that is transmitted using streamed chunks.  This is a binary
   format that is defined in Section 3.

                            Macintosh file type code(s):  N/A
   Person and email address to contact for further information:  see Aut

   Intended usage:  COMMON
   Restrictions on usage:  N/A
   Author:  see Authors' Addresses section

   The "message/ohttp-res" identifies an encrypted binary HTTP response
   that is transmitted using streamed chunks.  This is a binary format
   that is defined in Section 4.

   Subtype name:  ohttp-streamed-res
   Required parameters:  N/A
   Optional parameters:  N/A

   Interoperability considerations:  N/A
   Published specification:  this specification
